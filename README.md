# CS2520GroupAssignment
Final Assignment of CS2520
Group 10: Rosalu-Mae Wycoco, Daniel Porras, and Aye Mon

The objective of this group assignment is to collaboratively refactor and extend a project, The Cannon Game, that was previously completed in class. The goal is to modify the codebase to promote modular and object-oriented programming, making it more adaptable and easier to modify for future programmers that want to add additional features. In addition, we are to add new functional features, including:

1. Implement various types of projectiles.
2. Develop several target types with different movement patterns.
3. Transform the cannon into a moving tank.
4. Create "bombs" that will be dropped by targets onto the cannon.
5. Implement multiple cannons that can shoot at each other.
